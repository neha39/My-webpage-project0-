				<h2>Art and craft</h2>
				<p>
				  Drawing, painting, art and craft are all an un-detachable part of my life. My father always tells me how I used to make
				  random circles on his notepad when I was just two. May be that was the time I started a passionate journey towards my
				  favourite hobbies. As the time passed by, I was intoxicated by these hobbies and won many prizes for showcasing my talent.
				  I won a gold medal at nation level in drawing and many special prizes for colouring. These achievements made me more
					passionate. These hobbies are so engaging that it helps me get out of tension and anxiety. Different colours refresh
					my mind and a good piece of art can refresh yours too. Even today when I feel bored I pick some scraps and chunks,
					and make a beautiful piece out of it. But these days, my hobbies are buried under the burden of busy schedule that I
					hardly can manage moments for it.
